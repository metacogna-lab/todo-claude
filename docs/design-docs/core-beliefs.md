# Core Beliefs

1. **Data discipline first**: schemas precede services, services precede UI.
2. **Observability is UX**: Langfuse traces + DevTools captures are part of every feature definition.
3. **Deterministic layering**: enforce import boundaries to keep cognitive load manageable.
4. **Small, reviewable deltas**: design docs must be scoped so that implementation ships in <2 weeks.
5. **Rollback ready**: capture metrics + toggles up front; every doc needs failure signals + mitigations.
